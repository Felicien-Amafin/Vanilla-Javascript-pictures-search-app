Pixavenue is a picture search app that allows you to find different kind of images (animals, art, nature, peoples...).
First enter a search term. Scroll to find images you like. Download and create collections for your favorite ones!
I've build this app with HTML, SCSS and Vanilla Javascript, using mobile first responsive design approach.
For image queries, I've used Unsplash API . If users want to create collections for their favorite images, these are
stored on The Firebase Cloud Firestore service.
